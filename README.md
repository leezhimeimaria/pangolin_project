I've stored the downloaded data in "downloads" on alpine through the use of Global Connect Personal. From here I'll try to replicate what was done in class to fufil the following goals below. 

# My goals: 
1. Trimming
2. Aligning
3. Filtering the SNPs
4. If there is time: creating a PCA for the dataset
