# Pangolin Project
I've stored the downloaded data in "downloads" on alpine through the use of Global Connect Personal. From here I'll try to replicate what was done in class to fufil the following goals below. 

**My goals: (Goal change, there are a gatk vcf files available, so I will check if there are filtered and if they are, I will just skip to step 4 and 5)**

~~1. Trimming the SNPS~~

~~2.Aligning the SNPs to the reference genome~~

3.Filtering the SNPs & indels (I am redoing the filtering because it seems that there has only been a quality filter, and I'm not sure if the snps and indels have been filtered.)

5. creating a PCA for the dataset
 
6. create an FST for the dataset

Additional things I would like to do for the paper is to map the points that were provided.
