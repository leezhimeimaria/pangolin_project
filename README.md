# Pangolin Project
I've stored the downloaded data in "downloads" on alpine through the use of Global Connect Personal. From here I'll try to replicate what was done in class to fufil the following goals below. 

# My goals: 
1. Trimming the SNPS
2. Filtering the SNPs
3. Aligning the SNPs to the reference genome 
4. If there is time: creating a PCA for the dataset

Additional things I would like to do for the paper is to map the points that were provided.
